As the world's first Open Source Marketing Automation platform, Mautic faces a unique challenges.

Most people in Open Source circles have never heard of Marketing Automation or know there's an Open Source alternative to the tools they're using.

Many people in the wider world have never heard of Marketing Automation - they don't know what benefits it could bring to their organizations, or that they could access these benefits by using an Open Source tool.

You can imagine, therefore, how many people actually know about Mautic.

That's why your contributions matter.

Getting started as a marketer
*****************************

Mautic has a Marketing Team which you can read more about on the :doc:`Marketing Team </teams/marketing_team>` section.

The team holds regular meetings, which anybody can join - just hop into the :xref:`Mautic marketing team Slack` channel on Slack, and you'll get a notification when the next meeting is coming up. 

Finding a marketing task
========================

You can browse the :xref:`Mautic low- and no-code projects board` to find tasks or issues that match your skills and availability.

The board uses a layout, where each card represents a task and includes:

- **Description:** what the task is about
- **Status:** status of the task, such as 'Ready', 'In Progress', or 'Done'
- **Priority:** how urgent or important the task is
- **Size:** an estimate of the effort required

If you've identified a task you'd like to work on, leave a comment on the task or issue so that a team member can assign it to you.

If you need help, please reach out to the team. When you start working on a task, let others know in the Slack channel.

Work in the public domain
*************************

Unless there's significant reason not to, the default approach is openness and transparency. Work happens in the open, usually on the shared :xref:`Mautic Google Drive` or through the team Canva account. This ensures that if someone is unable to complete a task, it's easy for another contributor to pick up where they left off. It also means contributors can always find previous work if needed for future re-use. 

Please always ensure that you upload work at regular—ideally daily—intervals. Use the file prefix of WIP-filename to indicate that it's currently in progress.

Update regularly
****************

Please provide regular updates on the issue. If you can’t complete the task, add a comment on the issue or let your Team Lead know so someone else can take it over.

The team understands that life happens and it's easy to take on too much. No judgment. Contributors respect each other by providing as much notice as possible when they're unable to fulfill an assigned task.

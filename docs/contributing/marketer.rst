As the world's first Open Source Marketing Automation platform, we have quite a challenge on our hands.

Most people in Open Source circles have never heard of Marketing Automation. They don't even know there's an Open Source alternative to the tools they are using. 

Many people in the wider world have never heard of Marketing Automation - they don't know what benefits it could bring to their organizations, or that they could access these benefits by using an Open Source tool.

You can imagine, therefore, how many people actually know about Mautic.

That's why we need your help.

The Mautic Community Marketing Team
***********************************

We have a Marketing Team which you can read more about on the :doc:`Marketing Team </teams/marketing_team>` section.

The team holds regular meetings, which anybody can join - just hop into the :xref:`Mautic marketing team Slack` channel on Slack, and you'll get a notification when the next meeting is coming up. 


Finding a marketing task
------------------------

To find marketing tasks, browse the :xref:`Mautic No Code Tasks Board`.

The board uses a layout, where each card represents a task and includes:

- **Description**—what the task is about
- **Status**—for example, *Ready*, *In Progress*, or *Done*
- **Priority**—how urgent or important the task is
- **Size**—an estimate of the effort required

**How to get involved**

- Browse the board to find tasks or issues that match your skills and availability.
- Leave a comment on the task or issue to indicate your interest in working on it.

If you need help, reach out to the team. When you start working on a task, let others know in the Slack channel.

Work in the public domain
-------------------------

Unless there is significant reason not to, we default to being open and transparent. We work in the open, usually on our shared :xref:`Mautic Google Drive` or by sharing our work with the team on our Canva account. This ensures that if - for whatever reason - someone is unable to complete a task, it is easy for another contributor to pick up where they left off. It also means we can always find previous work that had been done if it needs to be re-used in the future.

Please always ensure that you upload your work at regular - ideally daily - intervals. You can use the file prefix of WIP-filename to indicate that it is currently in progress.

Update regularly
----------------

Provide regular updates on the issue. If you can’t complete the task, add a comment on the issue or let your Team Lead know so someone else can take it over.

We totally understand that life happens and it's easy to take on too much. No judgement at all. We try to be respectful of each other by ensuring we give as much notice as possible if we're not going to be able to fulfil a task assigned to us.

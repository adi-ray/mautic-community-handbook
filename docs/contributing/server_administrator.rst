Managing the Mautic infrastructure
**********************************

The Mautic services and websites run on servers which need supporting. The infrastructure working group monitors and updates these servers, keeping them up to date with the latest security patches and updates.

If you're an experienced Linux systems administrator and would like to support Mautic by maintaining these servers, your help would be greatly appreciated.

Getting started
***************

The first thing to do is join the :xref:`Mautic Community Slack` and then join the :xref:`Mautic community channel Slack` channel. Please introduce yourself and describe how you would like to contribute.

Due to the elevated access and trust required from members of the infrastructure working group, you must sign an NDA before taking on any tasks.

Initially you start by shadowing one of the existing team members and help with working through some of the routine tasks before taking on tasks yourself.

Accessing the Jira board
************************

Once you sign the NDA, the team invites you to the Jira board for the Infrastructure Working Group. From here, you can start to interact with outstanding tasks and request assignment to any that you feel able to take on.

The board and issues are private due to the nature of the work.

Work in the public domain
*************************

Unless there is significant reason not to, work should be open and transparent. The team documents tasks in :xref:`Mautic Google Drive` folders. This ensures that if - for whatever reason - someone is unable to complete a task, it's easy for another contributor to pick up where they left off. It also means you can find and re-use previous work in the future.

As this team is often working with sensitive information, work defaults to a private-open approach. Please make sure to update your issues on the private Jira board and share any resources in the private project folder that might be relevant to the tasks you are working on.

Update regularly
****************

Please provide regular updates on any tasks you are working on, and if at any point you're not going to be able to complete the task, please call that out by sending the Working Group Lead a message to inform them so that somebody else can pick it up. 

Life happens and it's easy to take on too much. There is no judgement. Being respectful of others means notifying the team early when you can't fulfill an assigned task.
